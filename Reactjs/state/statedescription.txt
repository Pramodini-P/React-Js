----------------------Properties------------------------


1)Properties are defined when components are created, whether by JSX or by pure JavaScript. State

2)it is only seen on the inside of component definitions.


-------------------State-----------------------------


1)State affects how a component behaves and renders.



2)When you think of state, you should think of an internal data-set which affects the rendering of components.




3)You, as the developer of a component, are the only person who should know what state your component needs, 

and the correct data types which should be accepted/provided.



4)State should be considered private data.

Setting State
----------------

1)Setting state should only be done from inside the component. 


2)You want update the data through setState 
                                   ---------



You cannot set new state values until the component has been mounted. 

This happens when 
it’s passed (whether directly or by nesting it) to the React.renderComponent() method.




Replacing State
---------------

Replace values in the state by using the replaceState() method. 





The replaceState() method is for when you want to clear out the values already in state, and add new ones.
